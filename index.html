			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> Zilla Tape <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1280x720 <br> I have always had a strong passion for playing video games and listening to music. That being said, I wanted to use my artistic craft to combine these passions of mine into a visual work of art  
			can change the way I experience both of these things. I took my own gaming clips from NBA 2K and synced them to a song I enjoy listening to. I compile the clips in a way similar to a basketball player's highlight tape and sync them to the song that I chose.
				I then added in effects that I believed to follow the flow and mood of the song as my final touch for the video.
